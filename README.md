## Bootstrap 5 Tutorial

Bootstrap 5 Crash Course by **Traversy Media**

This is a duplicate website of what Brad did in his tutorial. The code is not mine, I just followed along with the video so I could understand bootstrap more.

Some things that I added/changed:
* Changed the title names throughout the website
* Changed the images used
* Added a favicon
